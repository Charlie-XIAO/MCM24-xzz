# The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM'24)

## Problem 1

### Statement

Develop a model that captures the flow of play as points occur and apply it to one or more of the matches. Your model should identify which player is performing better at a given time in the match, as well as how much better they are performing. Provide a visualization based on your model to depict the match flow. *Note: in tennis, the player serving has a much higher probability of winning the point/game. You may wish to factor this into your model in some way.*

### Solutions

See [`q1.ipynb`](./q1.ipynb).

## Problem 2

### Statement

A tennis coach is skeptical that "momentum" plays any role in the match. Instead, he postulates that swings in play and runs of success by one player are random. Use your model/metric to assess this claim.
